# Old UI Restoration Theme

This repository was created so I could share my Vencord theme that uses mostly 96% other peoples' work that I've compiled into a single .css file while adding my own touches and fixes to it.

# How to apply the theme
1. In Discord, Head over to **User Settings**
2. Go to **Themes** then to **Online Themes**
3. Paste the following link in
```

```
