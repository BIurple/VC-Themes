# Old UI Restoration Theme

This theme aims to bring back **SOME** dearly missed elements from the Old discord UI such as the user panel and serverlist, and making other aspects look a little fancier.

**Most code is 96% other peoples' code that I've compiled into a single file with my own touches & fixes to it**
